# ***Lab Report: Installing and Removing RAM and Storage Devices***

---

### ***Part 1: Installing and Removing RAM***

***Power Down and Unplug***  
 *Begin by shutting down the system completely. Once it is off, disconnect the power cable from the back of the PC. For safety, press the power button once after unplugging this discharges any remaining electricity.*

***Open the Case***  
 *Remove the screws holding the side panel in place, then slide or lift the panel away to expose the motherboard and internal components.*

 ***Locate the RAM Slots***  
 *Find the long DIMM slots positioned beside the CPU socket. Each slot has small plastic locking tabs on both ends that hold the RAM in place.*

 ***Remove the RAM***  
 *Gently push both locking tabs outward. The RAM stick will pop up slightly, allowing you to pull it straight out of the slot.*

 ***Install the RAM***  
 *To insert new RAM, line up the notch on the module with the slot’s key. Firmly press the stick down until both side tabs snap back into position with a click, securing the module.*

###  ***Part 2: Installing and Removing Storage Devices***

 ***For SATA HDD/SSD:***  
 ***Locate Drive Bays***  
 *Find the storage bays: 2.5" slots for SSDs or 3.5" bays for traditional HDDs.*

 ***Remove a Drive***  
 *If a drive is already installed, unscrew or slide out the caddy, then disconnect the SATA data cable (to the motherboard) and SATA power cable (to the PSU).*

 ***Install a Drive***  
 *Place the new drive into the bay or caddy and secure it with screws. Reconnect the SATA data and power cables.*

 ***Locate the M.2 Slot***  
 *Look for the slim M.2 slot on the motherboard, usually between the PCIe slots.*

 ***Remove the Old Drive***  
 *Unscrew the tiny retention screw, then pull the M.2 drive out gently at a \~30° angle.*

 ***Install the New Drive***  
 *Slide the new drive into the slot at the same angle. Push it down flat against the board, then secure it with the retention screw.*

###  ***Part 3: Troubleshooting Notes***

 ***System Does Not Boot***

* *Double-check that the RAM is fully seated; both locking tabs should snap into place.*

* *If using multiple sticks, try booting with one at a time to identify any faulty module.*

 ***Drive Not Detected***

* *Make sure the SATA data and power cables are firmly connected.*

* *Enter the BIOS/UEFI to verify whether the system recognizes the new drive.*

 ***PC Will Not Power On After Install***

* *Recheck all PSU cables, especially those leading to the motherboard.*

* *Remove and reseat any new hardware to ensure proper contact.*
